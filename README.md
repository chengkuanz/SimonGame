# Simon Game

A fun and interactive memory game that tests your ability to remember a sequence of colors

## Description

This project is a Simon Game implemented in C++ using the [TGUI](https://tgui.eu/) and [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) libraries. In this game, players are required to memorize a sequence of colors and then replicate it correctly to proceed to the next cycle. The game becomes progressively harder as the sequence becomes longer with each level.

## How to Play

### Step 1: Start a New Game
Click the "Start New Game" button located at the center of the screen to initiate a game session. Once clicked, the program will generate a random sequence starting with one color.

### Step 2: Observe the Color Sequence
Pay close attention as the game showcases the sequence by lighting up one of the 4 color buttons (RED, GREEN, YELLOW, or BLUE) for 0.5 seconds, accompanied by a unique music note. Your task is to memorize this sequence.

### Step 3: Recreate the Sequence
After the sequence is displayed, it is your turn to replicate it by pressing the color buttons in the exact order presented. If you succeed, the game adds one more color to the sequence, challenging you to remember a longer pattern.

### Step 4: Continue or Restart
If you input the wrong color or take more than 5 seconds to make a selection, the game ends, and you will receive a message indicating the round you reached. You have the option to restart the game or quit.
